# Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.32-26.13 (2023-04-06)

Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
8.0, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.32 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.32.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package repositories
for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and RHEL. Obtaining packages using a package
repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the
deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on
https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.31-26.12:
- all output from wsrep_diag.sql goes to the same output stream
- better handling of SST scripts with ASAN builds
- memory leak around apply failure, ALTER TABLESPACE, fixed
- the wsrep patch works with lock order debug instrumentation
- removed check for innodb_lock_schedule_algorithm as it does not exist in MySQL 8

Known Issues:

- InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they
may not be copied over during SST.
