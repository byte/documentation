Codership is pleased to announce a new release of Galera Cluster for MySQL
consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.19 rc and Galera 4.5 rc,
wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.19 and numerous fixes and
enhancements specific to Galera replication. This is the first binary
release of MySQL-wsrep 8.0 series.

Notable new features in MySQL-wsrep 8.0 series are:

- Streaming replication will improve execution of large transactions
  by splitting transaction replication and applying into small fragments.
- Three new Galera system tables have been added into mysql database:
  wsrep_cluster, wsrep_cluster_members and wsrep_streaming_log. A database
  administrator has now a view in cluster membership status via system tables.
- Better integration with MySQL binlog group commit provides
  higher transaction throughput.
- New synchronization functions WSREP_LAST_SEEN_GTID(),
  WSREP_LAST_WRITTEN_GTID() and WSREP_SYNC_WAIT_UPTO_GTID() have been
  introduced to help applications to implement read-your-writes and
  monotonic-reads consistency guarantees.
- Optimized write set certification rules will improve foreign key support
  by reducing the number of foreign key related false conflicts in
  certification.

The packages are available for the following operating systems:

- CentOS 7
- CentOS 8
- Ubuntu 18.04

Known issues with this release:

- This release is not recommended for production use.
- When installing software on CentOS 8, dnf modules mysql and mariadb must
  be disabled before installing Galera Cluster software. This can be done
  by running `dnf module disable mysql mariadb`.
- Upgrading from earlier versions of Galera Cluster is not supported yet.
