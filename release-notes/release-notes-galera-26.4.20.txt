# Changes in Galera 4.20 (2024-08-02)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.20,
implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a
number of Linux distributions, including Debian 10 (Buster), 11 (Bullseye), and
12 (Bookworm), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal), 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS
(Noble), CentOS 7 and RHEL 7, 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package
repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the
deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com.

Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 4.19:
- improve error and warning messages handling in the library. Some of these
changes including hiding system error numbers and messages from thrown
exceptions, warning level messages being changed to info level messages when it
comes to gcomm error logging and GCS messages.

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need
to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
