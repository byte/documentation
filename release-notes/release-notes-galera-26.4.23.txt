# Changes in Galera 4.23 (2025-06-23)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.23,
implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a
number of Linux distributions, including Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12
(Bookworm), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal), 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble),
RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to
download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera
nodes.

This and future releases will be available from https://www.galeracluster.com or https://www.mariadb.com/ (as Codership has been acquired by MariaDB plc).

Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 4.22:
- CMake 4.0.0 is now supported for building, and compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed
- Faster node leave & shutdown on EVS close, so removing a node, planned or crashed completes faster and avoids "waiting for SST donor" delays that previously appeared
- Stateless/arbitrator flag is configurable, not just hardcoded in the garbd binary
- Extended membership service with member flags are now exposed, visible via SHOW STATUS
- Mix-segment clusters no longer trigger comparison doesn't meet irreflexive requirements

Known Issues:

- In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need
to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
