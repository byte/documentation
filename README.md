# The Codership Library

This repository contains the source code for the Codership Library, which includes our Documentation, Knowledge Base articles, an FAQ, and the Release Notes for our product releases. It's organized into a few distinct areas:

* **The Documentation** includes hundreds of pages of information on configuring every aspect of Galera, as well as information on administering a cluster. See http://galeracluster.com/library/documentation/

* **The Knowledge Base** provides Troubleshooting articles explaining how to resolve common problems. It also contains Best Practices articles for improving performance, ensuring against crashes, and other methods for getting the most out of Galera. See http://galeracluster.com/library/kb/

* **The FAQ** lists a number of frequently asked questions on Galera. Theyâ€™re mostly questions you might have before deciding to use Galera software, as well as how to get assistance and learn about Galera.  See http://galeracluster.com/library/faq.html

### Format
The documentation files here at GitHub use Sphinx Python Documentation Generator. Each document is written with the reStructuredText, a lightweight markup language. You can more easily read the Codership Library at http://galeracluster.com/library/.

### Corrections
We are continuing to expand and improve the documentation and other parts of the Codership Library.  We do our best, but sometimes we make mistakes. So if you see anything that should be corrected, rather than change it yourself, please email us:  library@galeracluster.com. Thanks in advance for your help.
